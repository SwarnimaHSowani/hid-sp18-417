\section{Ansible}

Ansible is a widely popular open-source tool used for automation of configuration management,
application deployment. Ansible is popular because it’s simple to understand, use and install.
An user doesn’t have to learn a cryptic language to use it.
Ansible may use two kinds of server for operation. One is the controlling server that has Ansible installed.
The controlling server deploys modules in the nodes through SSH channel. Ansible relies on agentless architecture.
No agents are required to be installed in the nodes, this eases the network overhead.
Modules are considered the units of work that can be written in scripting language such as Python

Originally, Ansible Inc. was setup to manage the product. Later in 2015, RedHat acquired Ansible.
