\section{Apache Cloud Stack}

Apache CloudStack is an open source that provides cloud management platform for IT
Enterprises and service providers. 
It provides virtualization of computing services over Internet(IaaS)
~\cite{ hid-sp18-417-techtarget-cloudStack}. 
CloudStack was originally developed by Cloud.com and was known as VMOps. 
In 2011, Citrix acquired the product and donated it to Apache 
~\cite{ hid-sp18-417-wiki-cloudstack}. 

The product currently supports:
\begin{itemize}
\item        Existing Virtual Machine Monitors/hypervisors
\item        AWS
\item        Open Cloud Computing Interface
\item        Open Grid Forum
\end{itemize}
 The basic deployment of cloud stack needs two machines: 
 A server and a hypervisor that is a monitoring system. 
 The process can be over simplified by configuring one machine 
 to serve both the purpose ~\cite{ hid-sp18-417-doc-cloudstack}.
