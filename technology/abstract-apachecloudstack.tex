Apache CloudStack is an open source that provides cloud management platform for IT
Enterprises and service providers. \\
‘‘CloudStack is being developed to help managed service providers and enterprise IT 
departments create and operate public cloud, private cloud or hybrid clouds
with capabilities equivalent to Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)’’  
~\cite{ hid-sp18-417-techtarget-cloudStack}. 
CloudStack was originally developed by Cloud.com and was known by the name VMOps. 
In 2011, Citrix acquired the product and donated it to Apache. 

The product currently supports:
\begin{itemize}
\item        Existing Virtual Machine Monitors/hypervisors
\item        AWS
\item        Open Cloud Computing Interface
\item        Open Grid Forum
\end{itemize}
 The basic deployment of cloud stack needs two machines: \\
 A server and a hypervisor that is a monitoring system. 
 The process can be over simplified by configuring one machine 
 to serve both the purpose.
