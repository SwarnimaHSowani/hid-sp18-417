\section{Apache Delta Cloud}

Apache DeltaCloud was developed in collaboration between Apache Foundation and Redhat
to provide a programming application that will 
facilitate management of different cloud interfaces and
It was supporting all the major cloud interfaces. 

In 2009, DeltaCloud was developed for the purpose of providing one unified 
API for the major cloud service. 
In 2011, it became a part of the Apacheâ€™s top level project. Unfortunately,
in 2015 the project was closed due to inactivity. 
The application though inactive is chosen for the study to understand 
the case behind the termination of the project. 
It is primarily because of lack of popularity RedHat withdrew the 
sponsorship ultimately resulting in the 
termination of the project \cite{hid-sp18-417-wiki-deltacloud}.
